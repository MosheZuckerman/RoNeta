        <h1>about me</h1>
    <li>
        I'm a 42-year-old father, finding immense joy in raising identical twinsâ€”vibrant nine-year-olds, Ronnie and Neta (RoNeta). Together with my life partner of the past 11 years, I embarked on a woodworking journey a decade ago, initially captivated by the art of carving. This fascination only deepened as I transitioned to crafting kitchens in a factory, nurturing both my passion and knowledge.
    </li>
    <li>
        The continuous journey of learning and evolving has fueled my fascination for this art. A pivotal moment arrived two years ago when I introduced a lathe into my toolkit, marking the inception of my exploration into the mesmerizing realm of woodturning. This journey has added a new dimension to my woodworking endeavors.
    </li>
    <li>
        A distinctive hallmark of my craftsmanship is its unwavering commitment to the authentic beauty of solid wood, free from artificial colors or stains. Each creation I bring to life becomes a canvas of natural hues, a testament to my enduring passion and dedication to the pure essence of woodworking.
