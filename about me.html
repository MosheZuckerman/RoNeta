        <h1>about me</h1>
        <li>I am a 42-year-old father of two. Ronnie and Neta (RoNeta) are twins aged 9 years old. I am happily
            married to my wife for 11 years. I started woodworking as a hobby 10 years ago and immediately fell in
            love with it. I started with carving. From there I started working in a factory building kitchens all
            the while continuing to learn... and love it more. Two years ago, I bought a lathe and I have been
            turning ever since.</li>
        <li>All my work is done using solid wood and no colors or stains. So, it is all-natural colors.</li>
